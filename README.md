# TinyFaas Interface

This repo is implementing an interface for [tinyFaas](https://github.com/PaulsBecks/tinyFaaS).

It allows a user to specify a tinyFaas endpoint, view the deployed functions, delete them and deploy new functions.

# Collecting tinyFaas functions

A user can also view publicly available functions collected in tinyFaasFunctions.json
